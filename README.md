<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Practice Page](./images/practice.png)


Part of Speech Quiz Web App is to provide an engaging and educational platform for users to test and improve their understanding of various parts of speech in the English language. The web app will present users with a series of quiz questions, where they will be required to identify the correct part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, etc.) for a given word. The addition of a timer feature will create a sense of urgency, encouraging users to respond quickly and test their knowledge under time constraints. By offering an interactive and time-bound experience, the web app aims to enhance users' grammar skills, reinforce their understanding of parts of speech, and promote a challenging yet fun learning environment.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Development Process


**Project Setup**: Started by setting up my development environment. Installed the necessary tools and frameworks such as Node.js and any additional libraries or dependencies required for my web app.

**Planning and Requirements Gathering**: Clearly defined the purpose, goals, and target audience of my web app. created a comprehensive plan.


**Backend-first Approach**:
As A full- stack I prefer Backend-first Approach because In this approach I can focus on developing and implementing the server-side logic, APIs, and database structure before working on the user interface and frontend components. This approach allows for the backend functionality to be thoroughly tested and validated before integrating it with the frontend

**Backend Development Process**: 
- Setup Express app 
- Implement Routes,and Controllers
- Handle Not Found Route
- Add Validations
- Handle Errors and Exceptions 


**Frontend Development Process**:
- Start search to find an inspiring design 
- Implement using html and css.
- convert it to react components
